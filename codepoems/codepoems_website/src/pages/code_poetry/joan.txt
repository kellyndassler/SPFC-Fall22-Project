The center was not holding. 
It was a country of bankruptcy notices and public-auction announcements and commonplace reports of casual killings and misplaced children and abandoned homes
and vandals who misplaced even the four-letter words they scrawled. It
was a country in which families routinely disappeared, trailing bad checks
and repossession papers. Adolescents drifted from city to torn city,
sloughing off both the past and the future as snakes shed their skins,
children who were never taught and would never now learn the games
that had held the society together. People were missing. Children were
missing. Parents were missing. Those left behind filed desultory missingpersons reports, then moved on themselves.
It was not a country in open revolution. It was not a country
under enemy siege. It was the United States of America in the cold late
spring of 1967, and the market was steady and the G.N.P. high and a
great many articulate people seemed to have a sense of high social purpose
and it might have been a spring of brave hopes and national promise,
but it was not, and more and more people had the uneasy apprehension
that it was not. All that seemed clear was that at some point we had
aborted ourselves and butchered the job, and because nothing else seemed
so relevant I decided to go to San Francisco. 
San Francisco was where the social hemorrhaging was showing up.
