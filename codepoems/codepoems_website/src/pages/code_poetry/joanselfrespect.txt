people with self-respect have the courage of their mistakes.  To have that sense of one’s intrinsic worth which constitutes self-respect is potentially to
have everything: the ability to discriminate, to love and to remain indifferent. To lack it is
to be locked within oneself, paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference. If we
do not respect ourselves, we are the one hand forced to despise those who have so few
resources as to consort with us, so little perception as to remain blind to our fatal
weaknesses. On the other, we are peculiarly in thrall to everyone we see, curiously
determined to live out – since our self-image is untenable – their false notion of us. We
flatter ourselves by thinking this compulsion to please others an attractive trait: a gist for
imaginative empathy, evidence of our willingness to give.
