More from Anywhere on the Web
October 31, 2006
PALO ALTO, Calif. - Oct. 31, 2006
- Facebook, the Internet's leading social utility,
today announced that for the first time people can access Facebook's share
functionality on multiple web sites to share video, photos, news and other content
with their friends on Facebook. Web sites that add a link to share on Facebook will
enable people to distribute content by posting it on their Facebook profiles or by
sending it to specific Facebook friends without ever leaving the original website.
Baron's Online, Boston.com, CollegeHumor.com, eBaumsworld.com, edgeio,
GameSpot.com, Geffen, IDG Entertainment, The Internet Movie Database (IMDb),
Jumpcut.com, MarketWatch.com, Miniclip.com, NBCSports.com, The New York Times,
People.com, Photobucket, PureVideo Networks, Sl.com, TerraPass Inc., The Onion,
Time.com, TV.com, U.S. News & World Report, The Wall Street Journal Online,
Washingtonpost.com, and Ziff Davis Media are among the first sites to include a link
to share on Facebook. "People share interesting content on the Web and on Facebook
all the time. Now we're making the sharing process more efficient by giving people a
simple structure to do it in," said Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO, Facebook.
"We're partnering with some good companies to make it easier for people to share
those websites' content through Facebook." When a Facebook user is surfing the Web
and clicks on the link to share on Facebook, a share box pops up with a preview of
the content that will be sent. Users make some choices about how and to whom they
want to share specific content and Facebook's share functionality distributes that
content to the appropriate users' accounts. To add the link to share on Facebook to
your website, please visit www.facebook.com/share_partners.php.
