    - This generative poem was inspired by the question posed by Hirschmann in her proposal of a feminist theory of freedom: 
    "How can women reject patriarchal discourse if we have participated in its construction and it makes us who we are? … How can we ever figure out who “we” are or what “we want” if the language and concepts we must use are antagonistic to the enterprise we seek to carry out, that is, are themselves barriers to women’s freedom? (99)"[link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/192090)

   My aim was to create a dynamically generative poem using pieces of text from feminists who stood to power in an embodied way via image, essay, manifesto, thought, or art to attempt to create "new discourse" outside of the technocratic, colonial, patriarchal center focused on efficiency, power, and oppression found in big tech and digital space. I also wanted to show the oppression of individuals and the erasure of self that social media profits from, and turn this erasure back on the social media companies themselves, while building a new discourse from the ashes of their words. (This is also a nod to show that we can never truly escape the social context of power and oppression, but perhaps only destroy and repurpose it). Phrases from these pieces are randomly selected to erase and replace intentionally selected words from Facebook's first PR announcement to reveal these power structures.Pulling from Joan Didion's "...the center does not hold..." essay about social strife in San Francisco, I initially disrupt the center of the PR announcement using these phrases, to accentuate the idea that power in big tech (symbolized by SF) cannot not hold when individuals and communities stand to power, and the disembodiment they create cannot be sustained. Each time, the poem is randomly generated and a bit different, and after each iteration, it is printed again to show the erasure over time. I also used a verbose coding style to reinforce a push against efficiency and technocratic environment, and combat the idea that code and logic are 'objective'.
